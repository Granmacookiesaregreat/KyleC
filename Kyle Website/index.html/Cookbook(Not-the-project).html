                <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li><br>

                <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li><br>
                <li>Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer. Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.</li><br>
                <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce. Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.</li><br>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>

Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</li><br>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>100 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers</li>
                <li>1 ¾ pounds ground pork</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons thinly sliced green onion</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
                <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
                <li>5 cups finely shredded Chinese cabbage</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil, egg and cabbage. Stir until well mixed.</li><br>
                <li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin. Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape. Roll edges slightly to seal in filling. Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</li><br>
                <li>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together; steam for 15 minutes, or until pork is cooked through.</li><br>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
